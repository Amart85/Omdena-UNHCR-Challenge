###### Using AI to Predict Droughts, Floods and Conflict Displacements in Somalia
The goal of this challenge was to create a solution that quantifies the influence of climate anomalies on forced displacement and/or violent conflict through satellite imagery analysis. The focus was on building models that would help to understand forced displacement, using historical satellite imagery that portrays either climate anomalies/changes in the environment or/and its interrelation with violent conflict.
